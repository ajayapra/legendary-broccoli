# [Navigating the ROS Filesystem](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem)

## Notes

- Completed tutorial using the `rosbuild` instructions.
- `roscd` is a neat tool for changing directories to a specific package or stack
- `rosls` is a neat tool for listing the files in a package or stack
- `rospack` and `rosstack` gets information about packages or stacks, like where they are or dependencies
