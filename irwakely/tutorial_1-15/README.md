# [Writing a Simple Service and Client (Python)](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28python%29)

## Notes

- Completed tutorial using the `rosbuild` instructions.
- Tutorial gets very confusing here has it doesn't do a very good jop of seperating what is needed with regards to `catkin` and `rosbuild`
